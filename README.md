# remote-process-function-caller
Calls process functions remotely in allocated memory.

# explanation
The purpose of this is to be able to call a process's functions without getting your module detected. It's a simple and useful feature I'll be implementing into my memory editing library soon.

(note that the way I did it is somewhat lazy, though it still works well)
